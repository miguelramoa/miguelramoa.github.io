            <h1 class="choose_text">Story</h1>
            <p class="lorem_text1">INDIVIDUATIO is an action-packed adventure game that takes you on a journey through the hero’s nightmare. The protagonist is a man who has been trapped in a world filled with monsters and obstacles. He must overcome his fears and collect the
                three masks that represent different emotions: anger, anxiety, and depression. As the hero navigates through this dark world, he will encounter various enemies that are colored to match the masks. To defeat these enemies, the hero must
                be wearing a mask with the same color. The journey is not just about defeating enemies, though. The hero must also face his inner demons and confront the root causes of his emotions. As the hero collects each mask, he will begin to feel
                a sense of liberation and clarity. He will start to see things in a new light and gain new perspectives on life. With each mask he collects, the hero will become stronger and more capable of overcoming the challenges that lie ahead. In
                the end, the hero must face the source of his nightmare and defeat it once and for all. Only then will he be able to wake up from his nightmare and live a life free from the shackles of his emotions. Join the hero on his journey and help
                him unlock the secrets of INDIVIDUATIO. The game follows the story of our main protagonist, a man who, at a given point if his life, lost his true identity. In the beginning, we (players) are hinted that our protagonist is in a coma state.
                Inside his mind we play in a big forest type of maze, that seems to have no ending. Without much information given, as we evolve and advance through the huge forest, we understand that our main objective is to find broken pieces of a mask
                that are scattered around the forest. With the puzzle of the mask completed, our hero can finally understand what happened and get a hold of himself and his life. Of course this won’t be an easy task as we are faced with several challenges
                all involving feelings and experiences that our protagonist has felt. Each piece of the mask has a certain colour that is linked to a feeling. We may think that colours are linked to good feelings and memories but in this story we explore
                the other side of things. As we are going to see in this game, every colour has two sides (as in life). For example: the colour Red relates to rage, violence and aggressive behavior. The colour blue is linked with depression, sadness and
                loneliness that our hero has faced. Green is our final colour, we may think its linked with good luck and charm, but actually, green may also be perceived negatively when associated with materialism, envy, greed and possessiveness. After
                gathering all the pieces of the mask, the player has to defeat the final boss, in order for him to wake up from the coma, and try to finally understand what made him fall in this state.</p>
