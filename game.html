                        The environment in INDIVIDUATIO is a dreamlike, surreal world that shifts and evolves as the player progresses through the game. It is composed of four sections, three of which are illuminated with the same color as one of the three masks that the player
                        must collect. These colored sections are where the masks float, waiting to be picked up by the player. However, once the player obtains a mask, enemies that match the color of the mask will appear, forcing the player to engage
                        in combat. The fourth section is the initial area where, once all three masks have been collected, a dragon will spawn, representing the final challenge that the player must overcome to escape the nightmare. The environment is
                        atmospheric and eerie, with low lighting and eerie sounds to create an unsettling and immersive experience for the player.

                        the screen and can include elements such as health and ammo counters, mini-maps, objective markers, and other interactive elements. The purpose of the HUD is to provide players with important information quickly and easily, without
                        the need for the player to pause the game or switch to a separate menu screen. INDIVIDUATION also applies such a concept as shown in the side figure. The relevant information throughout the game is displayed at different points

                        camera also has a slight shake effect to enhance the intense moments in the game. The shake effect is synchronized with the actions of the player, such as when the hero is engaged in combat with enemies. This camera design enhances
                        the immersive experience for the player, as they feel more connected to the hero and the action in the game.

                        file from a game already in progress. If the player starts a new game, the hero appears in the main area where there is an NPC to give context about his current situation. The player then, when he finishes talking with the NPC,
                        will be presented with a "tutorial" of battle where he discovers what are the mechanisms to defeat enemies. After this first confrontation, the player must move to the areas identified with colors and must do this in order to follow
                        the sequence GREEN, BLUE AND RED. If the player follows this sequence he will not have any problem collecting the masks however if the player does not follow this sequence a dialog box will appear advising on what to do. At the
                        end of collecting the masks, the player must return to the main area and defeat the final boss.
